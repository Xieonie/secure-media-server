# Authelia Users Database Configuration
# This file defines users, groups, and their access permissions
# 
# IMPORTANT: This is an example file. In production:
# 1. Use strong, unique passwords (preferably generated)
# 2. Hash passwords using Authelia's hash-password command
# 3. Secure this file with appropriate permissions (600)
# 4. Consider using LDAP or other external authentication providers

# Generate password hashes using:
# docker run --rm authelia/authelia:latest authelia hash-password 'your-password'

# Group definitions and their purposes
# admins: Full access to all services and admin interfaces
# users: Access to media services and basic functionality
# family: Access to media consumption only
# guests: Very limited access, media viewing only

# Access control rules are defined in the main configuration.yml file
# Example access patterns:
# - admins: Can access all services including admin panels
# - users: Can access media services, download clients, and request systems
# - family: Can access media servers (Plex/Jellyfin) and request systems
# - guests: Can only access media servers for viewing

# Security recommendations:
# 1. Change all default passwords immediately
# 2. Use unique, strong passwords for each user
# 3. Enable two-factor authentication for admin users
# 4. Regularly review and update user access
# 5. Remove unused accounts
# 6. Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity

# Password policy recommendations:
# - Minimum 12 characters
# - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
# - No dictionary words or personal information
# - Unique passwords for each service

# Two-factor authentication setup:
# Users can set up TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) using apps like:
# - Google Authenticator
# - Authy
# - Microsoft Authenticator
# - 1Password
# - Bitwarden

# Example of user with 2FA enabled (configured through Authelia web interface):
# The user will need to scan a QR code or enter a secret key into their authenticator app

# LDAP Integration (alternative to file-based users):
# For larger deployments, consider integrating with:
# - Active Directory
# - FreeIPA
# - OpenLDAP
# - Azure AD
# 
# Example LDAP configuration would replace this file-based approach
